The long-term goal of the project is to facilitate automated design
of machine learning pipelines in the case of imbalanced
distribution of target classes.

### Project status
Currently, only binary imbalanced classification setting is implemented.

[comment]: <> (AutoML options include [Imbaml]&#40;https://github.com/AxiomAlive/imbaml&#41;, [Auto-gluon]&#40;https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon&#41; and [FLAML]&#40;https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML&#41;.)

[comment]: <> (An example of running **IMBAML** using your data is available in `example.py`.)
